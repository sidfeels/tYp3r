# tYp3r

A simple tool to add subtle noise to text.

## Purpose

tYp3r helps bypass content filters by adding minor alterations to text while preserving readability. It's useful for sending uncensored text to language models without triggering refusals.

## How it works

1. Input your text
2. tYp3r applies random transformations:
   - Leetspeak substitutions
   - Random capitalization
   - Occasional extra spaces
   - Rare symbol insertions
3. Copy the transformed text

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
